# Archivematica workflow

This guide will show you how to upload a batch to Archivematica.

## Getting started

Do you have the necessary software installed? Can you log into the Archivematica interface?

## Preparing the transfer

Organize the content you will transfer. This will be a particular year of images (such as a group of 1931 air photos). Place all images in a folder named `objects`. **Please note:** `objects` must be all lowercase.

## Creating metadata

We will create basic metadata for each batch. "Metadata" is data about data. There are many kinds, but for our purposes, we will create metadata that tells us in general terms what the collection is about, who uploaded the collection, and any other relevant information.

Run MakeCSV by right clicking any file in the `objects` folder and selecting "makeCSV" from the menu. This will create a metadata folder and a metadata .csv file inside the objects folder. 

Open the `metadata.csv` file. This is where you will input your metadata.
