# Archivematica workflow

This guide will show you how to upload a batch to Archivematica.

## Getting started

Do you have the necessary software installed? Can you log into the Archivematica interface?

## Preparing the transfer

Organize the content you will transfer. This will be a particular year of images (such as a group of 1931 air photos). Place all images in a folder named `objects`. **Please note:** `objects` must be all lowercase.
