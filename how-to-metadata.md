# Archivematica metadata guide

## What is metadata?

**Metadata** is data about data. In this project, our metadata describes the air photos and helps us identify them. 

We will be using two kinds of metadata:
- **Descriptive metadata** describes the object (in this case, an air photo). 
- **Rights metadata** describes rights, permissions, and limitations on use of the objects.

Metadata can either describe an object (object-level metadata) or a collection (collection-level metadata). 

In our case, collection-level metadata for the 1921 series of air photos might say something like, "A collection of air photos covering the Niagara Region in 1921." Item-level metadata for the 1921 series would focus on one air photo, and might say something like, "An overhead view of the Welland Canal, 1921." These are just examples, however.

Here are some fields we will be using and their definitions:
